# AI Usage Log

A per-process record of how AI was used on this project. The Japanese version is at [AI-USAGE.ja.md](./AI-USAGE.ja.md) and carries identical content.

## Rules

- **Every time a process is completed, append to both this file and the Japanese version.** Update them before finishing the process and committing.
- Each entry must include: process number, date, AI tool used, what was delegated to AI, what the human decided, and how it was reviewed.
- Record honestly whether AI output was accepted as-is or modified.
- Write the entry during the process, not retroactively in bulk.

## Process 1: Understanding the spec and building the base

- **Date:** 2026-08-01
- **Tool:** Claude Code (Claude Opus 5)
- **Delegated to AI:**
  - Read the assignment page and extracted the requirements (Next.js v16+, App Router, detail view as a page rather than a modal, test code required, production-minded implementation).
  - Scaffolded the base project via `create-next-app` (Next.js 16.2.12 / App Router / TypeScript strict / Tailwind CSS v4 / `src` directory / `@/*` alias).
  - Set up the test harness — Vitest + React Testing Library (jsdom) — plus one smoke test to prove it runs.
  - Pinned the Node.js version (`.nvmrc` at 20.20.1; the default Node 18 cannot run Next.js 16).
  - Resolved the `postcss` / `sharp` advisories reported by `npm audit` by raising them to patched versions through `overrides` in `package.json`, confirming 0 vulnerabilities.
- **Human decisions:** No features and no architecture were built in this process. Scope was deliberately limited to the base environment, because **architecture will be worked through by a human together with AI in the next process.**
- **Review:** Verified that `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` all pass.
